pstream - A bandwidth, latency, and parallelism benchmark to test cache and memory.

Pstream is designed to explore the bandwidth and latency of the memory hierarchy with different size arrays and different number of threads. 

Includes gnuplot scripts for visualizing results.

Todo:
* Implement shuffer to visit each cacheline of N (settable with -p) pages exactly once before proceeding to the next page.
